Note that in order for SSL to work, you'll need to create two key stores: 
one for the server (server.keystore) and one for the client (client.truststore). 
These key stores should contain the SSL certificates needed to establish a secure 
connection between the client and server.

* the server's authentication mechanism is not very secure as it stores user credentials 
in plaintext in memory. A more secure approach would be to hash passwords and store the 
hashed passwords instead.
